# COMP2123 Assignment 2
My first coding assingment for COMP2123, implementing data structures and algorithms in python

A template was given in both Tree.py and Node.py. For the assignment I implemented:

In Node.py:
- __init__
- add_left_child, add_right_child
- update_weight

In Tree.py
- put
- move_subtree
- find_max_imbalance

See Assignment 2.pdf for more information.
